  <div class="aboutSubTitles">What is GitSpy?</div>
  <div class="missionDesc">
    GitSpy is a free passive-communication tool for fast-moving software development teams. It gives you a real-time view of what your developer teammates are working on locally, and what files they are affecting.
    <br><br>
    Just login, add your team’s shared project repo, and run the GitSpy setup instructions on your local computer. Once everyone on your team has done that, you’ll have a shared dashboard that shows each developer’s status &mdash; their most recent rebase, and what files they’ve touched since. Your status will update immediately upon commit &mdash; you don’t even have to push to GitHub first!
    <br><br>
    With GitSpy, you’ll never again have to ask “What files are you touching?” and you’ll never again be surprised by a merge conflict.

  <div class="aboutSubTitles">Can I use GitSpy with my workflow?</div>
  <div class="missionDesc">
    GitSpy makes these key assumptions about your workflow:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> Your team has a shared public repo whose master branch acts as your project’s “source of truth.” All teammates have at least collaborator permissions on the repo. </li>
      <br>
      <li> Collaborators git pull --rebase to get the latest code from this “source of truth.” GitSpy currently only works with a [rebase-based workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing/conceptual-overview).</li>
      <br>
      <li>New changes are incorporated into the “source of truth” repo via pull requests, i.e. code is never directly pushed to the team repo master branch. When pull requests are merged, the commit message always begins with “Merge pull request #[....]” </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    To use GitSpy effectively, it’s very important that your team’s workflow conforms with these assumptions. If you would like to see support for other workflows, feel free to [send us your feedback](mailto).

  <div class="aboutSubTitles">How do I get started with GitSpy?</div>
  <div class="missionDesc">
    Step One: Login with GitHub. On the “Authorize application” page, be sure there are green checkmarks next to any organizations/teams whose repos you want to use GitSpy with.
    <br><br>
    Step two: [Add a GitSpy dashboard]() for your team repo. Be sure to select your team’s shared “source of truth” repo, NOT your individual GitHub fork of this repo.
    <br><br>
    Step three: From the new dashboard page, click “setup instructions.” Follow the instructions to start reporting your local file activity to GitSpy. This setup only needs to be run once per person per dashboard.
    <br><br>
    Step four: Ask all your teammates to set up GitSpy, so you can see their activity on your GitSpy dashboard!
